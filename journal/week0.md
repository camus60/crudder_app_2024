### How to install the AWS CLI :mage:

This link will remind you about how to install the aws cli[aws cli installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)


### How to generate new User and AWS credentials

- Go to (IAM Users Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users) andrew create a new user
- `Enable console access` for the user
- Create a new `Admin` Group and apply `AdministratorAccess`
- Create the user and go find and click into the user
- Click on `Security Credentials` and `Create Access Key`
- Choose AWS CLI Access
- Download the CSV with the credentials

### Set Env Vars

Set these credentials for the current bash terminal

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Confirm that the AWS CLI is working and that I am the expected user

Type in this command in the bash terminal 
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see something like this as output:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIFBZRJIQN2ONP4ET4EK4",
    "Account": "655602346534",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::655602346534:user/andrewcloudcamp"
}
```

### It is important to enable billing as well

We need to turn on Billing Alerts to recieve alerts...


- In your Root Account go to the [Billing Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)
- Under `Billing Preferences` Choose `Receive Billing Alerts`
- Save Preferences

### First: Create an SNS topic


- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

We'll create a SNS Topic
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
```

Check your email and confirm the subscription.


### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
- We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```

### Create an AWS Budget

[aws budgets create-budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)

Get your AWS Account ID
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```sh
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```
